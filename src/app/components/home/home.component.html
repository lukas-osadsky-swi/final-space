	<div>
		Gary Goodspeed is a boisterous yet inept astronaut who, in the midst of working off the last few days of his
		five-year sentence aboard the prison spacecraft Galaxy One, encounters a mysterious planet-destroying alien. He
		befriends the alien, naming him Mooncake, and then discovers that Mooncake is wanted by the forces of a powerful
		telekinetic creature known as the Lord Commander. Gary and Mooncake embark on a quest to save the universe, together
		with the ship's computer HUE, an army of similar but unfalteringly loyal robots, and a growing crew of new
		shipmatesâ€”all while trying to uncover the mystery of what "Final Space" really is.
